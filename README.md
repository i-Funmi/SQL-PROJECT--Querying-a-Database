# QUERYING A MUSIC STORE DATABASE
### Description
In this project, I assisted the Chinook team understand the media in their store, their customers, employees and their invoice information using their database file.
The data was dutifully queried and analyzed to answer questions that helped the Chinook team make decisions that aided their increased productivity and better future decisions making.

### The Database
The Chinook music store database is a file that holds information about the Chinook music store. It includes eleven tables, including Tract, Artist, Album, Genre, Customer, etc with about 3500 rows (tracks).

### Analysis, Querying and Visualizations
Working with the SQLite tool, four questions were answered using the database file. The questions were answered using SQL queries and visualizations were used in explaining the results. 
The queries were saved in the QUERIES.txt file attached and the visualizations with insights were saved in the Presentation.pdf file.

### Conclusion
Using SQL queries and simple excel visualization, I successfully helped the Chinook store know their customers more, understand what they want and what drove the market and hence were able to make better decisions concerning their store.
